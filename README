Image gallery for Amazon S3. Javascript library that parses S3 bucket for image files and displays them in a gallery. Also automatically generates thumbnails and uploads them to S3 if necessary (and if the browser supports it).

Use util/s3enc.py to generate config file (Settings.js). The thumbnail prefix argument specifies where thumbnail files are uploaded - it's important not to put any important stuff in this location as everyone who has access to the image gallery will have write access to here (the policy document generated by the script places restrictions based on the path prefix and max file size).
